The given knowledge graph provides information about the metabolism of progesterone by CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP17A1. However, it does not provide information about the relationship between progesterone and OPRK1. Therefore, the answer to the question is that progesterone is metabolized by CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP17A1, but not OPRK1.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Read the given question and knowledge graph.\n2.
