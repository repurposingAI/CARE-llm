Additionally, Phencyclidine binds to GRIN3A, GRIN2A, and SIGMAR1, which are subunits of the NMDA receptor. The NMDA receptor is involved in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Therefore, it is plausible that Phencyclidine interacts with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.\n\n", "result_path": "\n    There are some knowledge graph triples extracted from path-based reasoning in the format: entity->relationship->entity.\n\n    There is a question and some knowledge graph.
